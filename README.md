# Hacktoberfest 2022

This repository contains contributing guidelines to participate in Hacktoberfest 2022 and make your very first contributions to [OpenFeature](https://docs.openfeature.dev/)! ❤️

> OpenFeature is an open standard for feature flag management, created to support a robust feature flag ecosystem using cloud native technologies. OpenFeature provides a unified API and SDK, and a developer-first, cloud-native implementation, with extensibility for open source and commercial offerings.

Harness is proud to support [OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev), a new CNCF project working to standardize feature flag functionality and integrations across the industry. This will help de-risk feature flags and let more engineering teams take advantage of world class feature flag tooling confidently. We recently talked about [our commitment to OpenFeature in this blog](https://harness.io/blog/openfeature-feature-flags), check it out!
